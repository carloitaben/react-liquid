# react-liquid

A middleground between writing a Shopify theme with Liquid and going headless.

## The Visionâ„¢

- Write Server Components that prerender Liquid [ahead of time](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components#server-components-without-a-server). No penalty in rendering.
- Fetch data at build time with [Async components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components#async-components-with-server-components).
- Add [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components#adding-interactivity-to-server-components) for rich interactivity.
- Use your favorite libraries, like `shadcn`, `frame-motion` and `radix-ui`.

## How would it look?

You should be able to collocate React Components with Liquid for incremental adoption.

```
 .
 â”œâ”€â”€ assets
 â”œâ”€â”€ config
 â”œâ”€â”€ layout
 â”œâ”€â”€ locales
 â”œâ”€â”€ sections
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ footer.liquid
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header-group.liquid
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ header.tsx <-- ðŸ˜®
 â”œâ”€â”€ snippets
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ container.tsx <-- ðŸ˜®
 â””â”€â”€ templates
 vite.config.ts <-- ðŸ˜®
```

A Vite plugin would then render the RSC tree with a custom reconciler and output it as `.liquid` files. It should look quite normal.

```diff
 .
 â”œâ”€â”€ assets
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .build.rsc...
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .build.rsc...
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .build.rsc...
 â”œâ”€â”€ config
 â”œâ”€â”€ layout
 â”œâ”€â”€ locales
 â”œâ”€â”€ sections
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ footer.liquid
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header-group.liquid
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ header.liquid
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ header.tsx
 â”œâ”€â”€ snippets
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ container.liquid
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ container.tsx
 â””â”€â”€ templates
 vite.config.ts
```

The Client Component payload would be placed in the `assets` directory, and used for hydration.

You would then `render` within Liquid or directly from React if you make the `theme.liquid` layout a Server Component ðŸ˜ˆ

```diff
 .
 â”œâ”€â”€ assets
 â”œâ”€â”€ config
 â”œâ”€â”€ layout
-â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme.liquid
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme.tsx
 â”œâ”€â”€ locales
 â”œâ”€â”€ sections
 â”œâ”€â”€ snippets
 â””â”€â”€ templates
 vite.config.ts
```

On server components, Liquid tags should be JSX. Objects should be available as globals.

```tsx
function Header() {
  return <unless condition={request.pageType === "index"}>{shop.name}</unless>
}
```

I should be able to detect references to global objects with some AST which is neat.

That component would output something like this

```liquid
{%- unless request.page_type == 'index' -%}
 {shop.name}
{%- endunless -%}
```

The reconciler would have to translate the expression passed to the `condition` prop to prevent LSPs from reporting syntax errors all over the place. Imagine writing a javascript to liquid translation library ðŸ¤ª

On Client Components, the reconciler could use the translation layer to dynamically render basic Liquid templates. Globals would have to be passed as props from Server Components. As a starting point I would simply error when trying to render Liquid JSX on the client.

## Things to figure out

- [] get the reconciler working for real
- [] get `renderToLiquid` working
- [] make some components
- [] use the vite environment api to render both the RSC and RCC trees
- [] wire shit up (useful ref https://github.com/odestry/adastra)
- [] .d.ts file with types for all new jsx elements
- [] autogenerate typescript types based on the grammar definitions they have here https://github.com/Shopify/theme-tools/tree/main/packages/vscode-extension.

## Will I finish this?

Probably not
